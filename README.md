# Mikasa-world
🌟 Mikasa World 🌟
My submission for the Codex.io Hackathon! 🎉

A creative and interactive website inspired by Attack on Titan, showcasing:

🐱 Kitty Chat: A playful feature with Mikasa-themed responses.
👤 Mikasa Bio: A quick look into Mikasa’s character.
📷 Gallery: A collection of visuals and fan art.
🎮 AOT Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A fun twist on the classic game with an anime theme.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project merges web development creativity with my love for anime. 💻✨
